This is my implementation of [Wabbit](https://www.dabeaz.com/wabbit.html), written as part of David Beazley's [excellent class on compilers](https://www.dabeaz.com/compiler.html).

Note: no materials from the course are present in this repo, except for a few generic Wabbit programs for testing.

This crate provides a Wabbit interpreter, a typechecker, a compiler that uses LLVM IR, and an export of the interpreter to WebAssembly.

Here is a link to more detailed documentation: https://chenson2018.github.io/wabbit/wabbit/
